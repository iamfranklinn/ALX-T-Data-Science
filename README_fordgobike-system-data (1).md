This is the 3rd project of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Course. I have used Python visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships.

### Summary of Findings
I was interested in finding observations related to the duration in minutes of the trips and some of the questions I was most interested were:

- What is the gender distribution of the users?
- Is there any relationship between gender and bike share for all trips?
- What is the age distribution of the users?
- What day of the week is the service often used?


#### Exploration

- I saw longer trips in April and August while May had fewer trips that lasted as long. When adding the subscription variable (user_type) we found subscribed users had shorted bike trips than normal users(customers) consistently. Normal users (Customers) bike times were consistently longer than subscribers throughout the year.

- I found there was a trend between number of trips and average trip duration coming to just under 10 minutes, with some trips going up to 300 minutes and more! I found there was a surprisingly consistent minimum of bike trips throughout the years, always just below 200 minutes.


### Dataset
- This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the duration of Febraury 2019.

### Insights
I found insights, a couple of which were:

- Males make up 74.6 of the users while females make up 23.3%.
- Males are more likely to share bikes for all trip than females.
- Most of the users are between the ages 20-40.
- There are more rides recorded during the weekday than the weekends.
